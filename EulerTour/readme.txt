Euler graph implementation 

Files: 
Driver.java - file to read the input graph, call method to find a tour in it, verify for correctness and print output
Vertex.java - file to define a vertex and methods for it 
Edge.java - file to define an adge and methods for it 
Graph.java - file to break a given graph, merge the subtours and verify it
circularList.java - file to implement a circular list and merge the subtours

Input: number of vertices, number of edges, list of connecting edges

Output: Euler graph
