Project 5:
Use Java's TreeSet or TreeMap to solve the following problems.

1. Given an array A of integers, and an integer X, find how many pairs of elements of A sum to X:

2. Given an array A, return an array B that has those elements of A that occur exactly once, in the same order in which they appear in A  

3. Given an array A of integers, find the length of a longest streak of consecutive integers that occur in A (not necessarily contiguously)
